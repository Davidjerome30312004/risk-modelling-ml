# Notebooks Overview

This directory contains the core Jupyter notebooks representing the methodological workflow used in the MSc dissertation project on wildfire susceptibility modelling.

The notebooks outline:

- Data collection and preprocessing  
- Study-area clipping and feature preparation  
- Train-test separation and class imbalance handling  
- Model development and hyperparameter tuning  
- Model evaluation and comparison  
- SHAP-based interpretability  
- Generation of the wildfire susceptibility map  

## Important Notice

Due to university policy and ongoing research development, raw datasets and full experimental outputs are not publicly released at this stage.

The notebooks are provided as structured methodological references demonstrating the modelling pipeline rather than fully executable, data-complete implementations.

Full reproducibility materials may be made available following formal publication.
