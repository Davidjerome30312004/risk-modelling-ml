# Wildfire Susceptibility Modelling using Machine Learning
This repository supports an MSc dissertation works. Some components are intentionally abstracted or omitted to align with planned peer-reviewed publications.

## outline 
Developed as part of an MSc in Satellite Data Science (University of Leicester), this work investigates how machine learning models can be applied to wildfire risk assessment within a spatially constrained study area (Pacific Palisades, California).

The framework compares multiple classification algorithms under severe class imbalance and translates model outputs into an interpretable wildfire susceptibility surface.
